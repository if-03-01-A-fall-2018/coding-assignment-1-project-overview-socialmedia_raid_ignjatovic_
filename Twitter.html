        <p class="Text">Twitter is known as a micro-blogging site. Blogging has been around for some time. Usually blogging consists of people setting up basic websites where they write about whatever they want, whether it be politics, sport, cooking, fashion etc. Posting a message is known as a tweet. People make connections by following other people’s twitter feeds. Once you click follow, anything that person or organisation says will appear on your timeline. You can tweet a person by putting the @ symbol before their username.</p>
        <p class="Text">Retweeting is also a big part of Twitter. This is where tweeps, slang for people who use the website, repeat tweets from other users to their own followers. A lot of activity on Twitter involves the use of hashtags. These are handles used to aggregate tweets about the same subject. For example, if a lot of people were attending a conference and wanted people to know what the speakers were saying they would tweet to an agreed hashtag by using the # symbol followed by the agreed name.</p>
        <p class="Text">Tweets are instantaneous. In seconds, a tweet can alert the world to disasters. Like in 2008 when Mike Wilson tweeted first about a plane crash in Denver. How did he know? He survived the crash. Or like the Twitter user who tweeted from inside a hotel in Mumbai as terrorists murdered people in the lobby in the 2008 attack on the Indian city. Essentially, Twitter is a form of texting. However, rather than sending that text to one person, Twitter allows users to broadcast their message all over the site. And what’s more, it’s free.</p>
